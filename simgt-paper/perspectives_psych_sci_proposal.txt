The advent of social media, the internet, advances in telecom and the willingness of humans to participate en mass with such technologies is striking from various perspectives.  For the purposes of our argument, it is striking in respect to the opportunities for the scientific understanding of human behavior, en mass and in situ.  Further, in this respect, several disciplines yeild supreme:  computer science, information science, and engineering. These are the disciplines with little committment to biological constraints with respect to the models used to explain human behavior or the historical precedent set forth by the process of scientific theory development.  In short, the explanation space is underconstrained.  Other disciplines, typically those that deal with humans en mass have also leveraged electronic communication (to include large group experimentation) to explore scientific theory with respect to human behavior in group:  ecnomics, sociology, and decision sciences.  These explanations are underconstrained in a differnt way: they fail to capture the multi-level, multi-scale aspect of human systems (REF: RCP).  We argue elsewhere that a perspective is needed that captures multiple-constraints simultaneousely, what we have called the riciprocal constraints paradigm.

The new idea we propose here is that it is possible to develop methodologies that respect psychological modeling and other levels simultaneously.  By example, we illustrate this method with large-scale, observational data about human behavior online.  Further, this work points out the glairing deficienceis in such an approach and ways to rigorously deal with them.  In short, this approach is not just observational but also attempts to levearge theory from multiple disciplines simultanesouly.  

The theoretical statement is about methods and cross-level theory; the supportive evidence is that it is
